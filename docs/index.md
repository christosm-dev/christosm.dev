# About Me

My name is Christos Michaelides. I am a software engineer currently looking for a new challenge within DevOps domains, where I have worked primarily during the last 10 years of my career.

My background spans the entire spectrum of system integration and release management activities, including maintaining associated DevOps infrastructure.

As an engineer, I love communicating software architecture, technical knowledge and helping others by iterating over team processes in order to improve collaboration between project stakeholders.

# My 2026 Portfolio

This documentation website is a basic portfolio I am starting to collate for my imminent interviews and professional certification preparation planned for 2026.

The projects on the side bar on the left have information about technologies and concepts I have revisited recently and the projects I practiced to refresh my knowledge in these knowledge domain areas.

I have a special interest in visualising architecture and the C4 Literate Python project is a project I started recently to explore feasibility of an idea I had recently around it.

This documentation website will be accompanied by an infrastructure project, which will be hosted on a Contabo VPS soon in a sandboxed environment, which will be custom built as part of this portfolio and documented here.

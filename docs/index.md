## About Me

My name is Christos Michaelides. I am a software engineer currently looking for a new challenge within DevOps domains, where I have worked primarily during the last 10 years of my career.

My background spans the entire spectrum of system integration and release management activities, including maintaining associated DevOps infrastructure.

As an engineer, I love communicating software architecture, technical knowledge and iterating over team processes in order to improve collaboration between project stakeholders.

# My 2026 Portfolio

This website is a a summary of a basic portfolio for my imminent interviews and professional certification preparation planned for 2026.

The projects on the side bar on the left have information about technologies and concepts I have revisited recently and the projects I practiced to refresh my knowledge in these knowledge domain areas.

This documentation website will be accompanied by an infrastructure project, which will be hosted on a Contabo VPS soon in a sandboxed environment, which will be custom built as part of this portfolio and documented here.

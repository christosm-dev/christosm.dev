### Every Project Should Have:

1. **README.md** at root level containing:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Technologies used
   - Quick start guide
   - Architecture overview
   - Links to detailed documentation

2. **docs/** directory with:
   - Detailed documentation
   - Architecture diagrams (when applicable)
   - Deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Interview talking points

3. **Code quality**:
   - Clear comments explaining complex logic
   - Consistent formatting
   - Security best practices
   - Error handling
   - Logging where appropriate

4. **Configuration files**:
   - `.gitignore` (exclude secrets, temporary files)
   - Example configuration files (`.example` suffix)
   - Clear documentation of required variables

## 🔐 Security Guidelines

**Critical**: Never commit sensitive information to version control.

**Always exclude**:
- API keys, tokens, passwords
- Private SSH keys
- Cloud provider credentials
- `.tfstate` files (use remote backend)
- Personal information
- VPS IP addresses (unless necessary)

**Always include**:

## 📝 Working with Claude Guidelines

### Context Provision
When starting work on a project, provide:
- Which project (by number/name)
- Current phase or goal
- Specific technologies involved
- Any blockers or issues

### Code Creation
- **Verbose explanations**: Christos prefers detailed explanations when introducing new concepts
- **Complete codebases**: Provide full, working code rather than snippets
- **Documentation**: Include README files with context
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, build up to advanced

### File Management
- Always use `/home/claude` as working directory
- Move final outputs to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
- Create zip files for multi-file projects
- Maintain project structure consistently

### Documentation Style
- Clear, professional tone
- Suitable for portfolio/interview use
- Include "why" not just "how"
- Career context and talking points
- Certification alignment notes

## 🎯 Career Alignment

### For Each Project, Consider:

**Interview Talking Points**:
- What problem does it solve?
- What technologies/patterns does it demonstrate?
- What decisions did you make and why?
- What would you do differently at scale?

**Certification Relevance**:
- Which exam topics does it cover?
- How can it be used as study material?
- What hands-on practice does it provide?

**Industry Relevance**:
- Aerospace/Defense: Emphasize security, reliability
- Financial Services: Highlight compliance, audit trails
- Healthcare: Focus on data protection, reliability
- Government: Showcase security clearance suitability

## 🔄 Project Evolution

Projects may evolve through phases:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Basic working implementation
2. **Phase 2: Production** - Hardening, security, monitoring
3. **Phase 3: Advanced** - Scaling, optimization, advanced features

Document each phase separately to show progression and learning.

## 📊 Success Criteria

Each project should:
- ✅ Run successfully (locally and/or deployed)
- ✅ Have comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Demonstrate best practices
- ✅ Include security considerations
- ✅ Provide interview material
- ✅ Align with certification goals
- ✅ Be portfolio-ready (public GitHub)

## 🚀 Deployment Targets

**Development/Testing**:
- Local machine (WSL, Docker Desktop)
- Minikube (Kubernetes)
- Local Docker daemon

**Production/Demo**:
- Contabo VPS (primary)
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) - optional
- GitHub Pages (static sites)

## 📞 Communication Style

**Christos prefers**:
- Detailed technical explanations
- Complete working examples
- Comprehensive documentation
- Progressive learning approach
- Career-focused context
- Interview preparation insights

**Avoid**:
- Oversimplification without context
- Partial code snippets without full examples
- Assumptions about prior knowledge
- Generic advice without career relevance

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

These projects serve multiple purposes:
1. **Hands-on learning** - Build real skills through practice
2. **Certification preparation** - Align with exam objectives
3. **Portfolio building** - Demonstrate capabilities to employers
4. **Interview preparation** - Provide discussion material
5. **Career transition** - Bridge from telecoms to target industries

Each project should support all five purposes where possible.

## 📖 Quick Reference Commands

### Starting a New Project Session
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/claude/<project-name>

# Check project structure
ls -la

# Review README
cat README.md
```

### Completing Work
```bash
# Copy to outputs
cp -r /home/claude/<project-name> /mnt/user-data/outputs/

# Or create zip
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs
zip -r <project-name>.zip <project-name>/

# Present to user
# Use present_files tool
```

### File Organization
```bash
# Create standard structure
mkdir -p {terraform,k8s,ansible,docs,scripts}

# Create standard files
touch README.md .gitignore
```

## 🔄 Iterative Development

Projects will be developed iteratively:
1. **Initial implementation** - Get it working
2. **Documentation** - Explain what was built
3. **Enhancement** - Add features/complexity
4. **Optimization** - Improve performance/security
5. **Interview prep** - Add talking points

Each iteration should be clearly documented.

## 📝 Notes for Claude

- Christos is hands-on and wants to understand the "why" behind decisions
- Security is important (targeting SC clearance roles)
- Documentation should be interview-ready
- Code should be production-quality where possible
- Always think about how projects demonstrate skills for target roles
- Link concepts to certification exam topics when relevant

## 🎯 Current Focus

3. **vps-sandbox-platform** - Planning phase (not yet started)
4. **Terraform certification preparation** - Ongoing
5. **Kubernetes learning** - Preparing for CKA
6. **Portfolio organization** - Structuring projects for presentation

## 📊 Project Status Tracking

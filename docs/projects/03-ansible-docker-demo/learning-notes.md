# Ansible Project - Hands-On Learning Notes

**Date**: February 4, 2026
**Project**: 3-ansible-docker-demo
**Goal**: Learn Ansible fundamentals through hands-on practice
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

This document captures hands-on learning from running and testing the ansible-docker-demo project. The project demonstrates Ansible automation by configuring Docker containers as if they were production servers.

**What Was Accomplished**:
- Set up Docker infrastructure with 3 target containers
- Configured Ansible connectivity to manage remote hosts
- Executed playbooks to automate server configuration
- Installed and configured nginx web servers across all hosts simultaneously
- Verified automation results
- Understood idempotency through practical demonstration

---

## 🛠️ Technical Setup Completed

### Environment Configuration

**Prerequisites Installed**:
- Docker Engine (running)
- Docker Compose V2 (v5.0.2)
- Ansible (with sshpass for password authentication)

**Infrastructure Deployed**:
- 3 Ubuntu 22.04 Docker containers (ansible-target1, target2, target3)
- SSH servers enabled on ports 2221, 2222, 2223
- Nginx web servers exposed on ports 8081, 8082, 8083
- Isolated bridge network for container communication

### Issues Encountered & Resolved

#### Issue 1: Docker Compose Compatibility Error
**Problem**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'
```
- Old `docker-compose` (v1.29.2) incompatible with Python 3.12
- Python 3.12 removed the `distutils` module

**Solution**:
- Used Docker Compose V2 command syntax: `docker compose` (space, not hyphen)
- Docker Compose V2 is written in Go, has no Python dependencies

**Learning**: Always check tool versions and migration paths when upgrading system Python versions.

#### Issue 2: Ansible SSH Password Authentication
**Problem**:
```
msg": "to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program"
```

**Solution**:
- Installed `sshpass`: `sudo apt install sshpass -y`
- Allows Ansible to pass passwords to SSH non-interactively

**Learning**:
- Ansible uses SSH for communication (agentless architecture)
- Password authentication requires `sshpass`
- Production environments use SSH keys instead (more secure)

#### Issue 3: Missing Web Server Port Mappings
**Problem**:
```
curl: (1) Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed
```
- Port 2221 mapped to SSH (port 22), not nginx (port 80)

**Solution**:
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to expose nginx ports:
  - target1: `8081:80`
  - target2: `8082:80`
  - target3: `8083:80`
- Restarted containers: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

**Learning**:
- Docker port mappings are `host:container`
- Multiple ports can be exposed per container
- Configuration changes require container restart

## 📚 Ansible Concepts Learned

### 1. Ansible Architecture

**Agentless Design**:
- No software to install on managed hosts
- Uses SSH + Python (already on most Linux systems)
- Control node (your machine) connects to managed nodes (containers)

**Key Components**:
- **Control Node**: Where Ansible runs (your laptop/workstation)
- **Managed Nodes**: Servers being configured (the 3 Docker containers)
- **Inventory**: List of hosts to manage ([inventory.ini](file:///home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo/inventory.ini))
- **Playbook**: YAML file describing automation tasks ([playbook.yml](file:///home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo/playbook.yml))
- **Modules**: Reusable units of work (apt, service, template, file, copy)

### 2. Inventory Management

**File**: [inventory.ini](file:///home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo/inventory.ini:1-15)

**Structure Learned**:
```ini
[webservers]                          # Group name
target1 ansible_host=localhost ansible_port=2221
target2 ansible_host=localhost ansible_port=2222
target3 ansible_host=localhost ansible_port=2223

[webservers:vars]                     # Group variables
ansible_user=ansible
ansible_password=ansible
ansible_connection=ssh
```

**Key Concepts**:
- **Groups**: Organize hosts by function (webservers, databases, etc.)
- **Host Variables**: Connection details specific to each host
- **Group Variables**: Shared settings for all hosts in a group
- **Targeting**: Can run playbooks against all hosts, specific groups, or individual hosts

**Production Difference**:
- Demo uses static inventory with hardcoded passwords
- Production uses dynamic inventories (cloud APIs, CMDBs) with SSH keys

### 3. Playbook Structure

**File**: [playbook.yml](file:///home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo/playbook.yml:1-79)

**Components Learned**:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Web Servers          # Play name (descriptive)
  hosts: webservers                    # Target group from inventory
  become: yes                          # Use sudo for privileged tasks

  vars:                                # Variables for customization
    nginx_port: 80
    document_root: /var/www/html

  tasks:                               # List of actions to perform
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      notify: Start nginx              # Trigger handler if changed

  handlers:                            # Triggered actions
    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

**Learning Points**:
- Playbooks are declarative - describe desired state, not steps
- YAML syntax is human-readable and version-controllable
- Tasks run in order on all hosts
- Handlers only run if notified and run at the end of the play

### 4. Modules Used

#### apt Module (Package Management)
```yaml
- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
```
- Manages Debian/Ubuntu packages
- `state: present` ensures package is installed
- `update_cache: yes` runs `apt update` first

#### service Module (Service Control)
```yaml
- name: Ensure nginx is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```
- Manages systemd/init services
- `state: started` ensures service is running
- `enabled: yes` configures service to start on boot

#### template Module (Jinja2 Templates)
```yaml
- name: Create custom index.html
  template:
    src: templates/index.html.j2
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    mode: '0644'
```
- Renders Jinja2 templates with variables
- Creates host-specific configurations
- Uses Ansible facts for dynamic content

#### file Module (Directory Management)
```yaml
- name: Create a custom directory
  file:
    path: /opt/ansible-demo
    state: directory
    mode: '0755'
```
- Creates directories and manages permissions
- `state: directory` ensures directory exists
- `mode` sets Unix permissions

#### copy Module (File Content)
```yaml
- name: Copy a sample file
  copy:
    content: |
      Hostname: {{ ansible_hostname }}
    dest: /opt/ansible-demo/info.txt
    mode: '0644'
```
- Creates files with inline content
- Can also copy files from control node
- Supports template-like variable substitution

### 5. Jinja2 Templating

**Files**:
- [templates/index.html.j2](file:///home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo/templates/index.html.j2)
- [templates/nginx-site.conf.j2](file:///home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo/templates/nginx-site.conf.j2)

**Variable Substitution**:
```jinja2
<h1>Server: {{ ansible_hostname }}</h1>
<p>OS: {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}</p>
<p>IP: {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}</p>
<p>Deployed: {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}</p>
```

**Key Learning**:
- `{{ variable }}` syntax for variable substitution
- Ansible automatically gathers "facts" about each host
- Templates create unique configurations for each server
- Same template produces different output per host

**Facts Available**:
- `ansible_hostname` - Server hostname
- `ansible_distribution` - OS distribution (Ubuntu)
- `ansible_distribution_version` - OS version (22.04)
- `ansible_default_ipv4.address` - Primary IP address
- `ansible_date_time.iso8601` - Current timestamp

### 6. Idempotency

**Definition**: Running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result without unintended side effects.

**Practical Demonstration**:

**First Run**:
```
TASK [Install nginx] ************************************
changed: [target1]
changed: [target2]
changed: [target3]
```
- Tasks show "changed" (yellow)
- Nginx was installed
- Execution took ~2-3 minutes

**Second Run**:
```
TASK [Install nginx] ************************************
ok: [target1]
ok: [target2]
ok: [target3]
```
- Tasks show "ok" (green)
- Ansible detected nginx already installed
- No changes made
- Execution took ~10-30 seconds

**Why This Matters**:
- Safe to run playbooks repeatedly
- Won't break working systems
- Useful for drift correction (bringing servers back to desired state)
- Much safer than shell scripts that might create duplicates or errors

### 7. Handlers

**Purpose**: Triggered actions that run only when notified and only once at the end of a play.

**Example from playbook.yml**:
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Create custom nginx configuration
    template:
      src: templates/nginx-site.conf.j2
      dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    notify: Reload nginx                # Triggers handler if template changes

handlers:
  - name: Reload nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: reloaded                   # Graceful reload, not full restart
```

**Learning Points**:
- Handlers run at the end of the play
- Only run if notified by a task
- Only run once even if notified multiple times
- Efficient service management (no unnecessary restarts)

### 8. Tags

**Usage in Playbook**:
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Update apt cache
    apt:
      update_cache: yes
    tags: [setup]

  - name: Install nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
    tags: [nginx]
```

**Selective Execution**:
```bash
# Run only nginx tasks
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags nginx

# Run only setup tasks
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags setup

# Skip nginx tasks
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags nginx
```

**Use Cases**:
- Run only specific parts of a playbook
- Skip time-consuming tasks during development
- Selective updates in production

---

## 🎬 Commands Executed & Results

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/cm/portfolio/3-ansible-docker-demo

# Start Docker containers
docker compose up -d --build

# Verify containers running
docker compose ps
```

**Result**: 3 containers running (ansible-target1, target2, target3)

### Ansible Connectivity Testing

```bash
# Test Ansible ping
ansible all -m ping
```

**Result**:
```
target1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
target2 | SUCCESS => ...
target3 | SUCCESS => ...
```

**Learning**: The ping module doesn't use ICMP - it tests Python/SSH connectivity.

### Playbook Execution

```bash
# Run the playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

**Result**:
- All 3 servers configured simultaneously
- Nginx installed and started
- Custom HTML pages deployed
- nginx configuration applied
- Services enabled for auto-start

**Execution Summary**:
```
PLAY RECAP *********************************************
target1 : ok=8  changed=7  unreachable=0  failed=0
target2 : ok=8  changed=7  unreachable=0  failed=0
target3 : ok=8  changed=7  unreachable=0  failed=0
```

### Verification

```bash
# Test web servers
curl http://localhost:8081  # target1
curl http://localhost:8082  # target2
curl http://localhost:8083  # target3
```

**Result**: Beautiful HTML pages with server-specific information:
- Each server shows its unique hostname
- OS distribution: Ubuntu 22.04
- IP addresses differ per container
- Deployment timestamps

### Ad-Hoc Commands

```bash
# Check disk space
ansible all -m shell -a "df -h"

# Check memory
ansible all -m shell -a "free -m"

# Check nginx status
ansible all -m shell -a "systemctl status nginx" --become

# View info.txt file
ansible all -m shell -a "cat /opt/ansible-demo/info.txt" --become
```

**Learning**: Ad-hoc commands allow quick one-off tasks without writing playbooks.

## 📖 Key Takeaways

### Most Important Concepts

1. **Idempotency is Powerful**: Ansible's idempotent nature means you can run playbooks repeatedly without fear of breaking things. This is a massive advantage over shell scripts.

2. **Declarative > Imperative**: Describing the desired state (declarative) is simpler and more maintainable than specifying steps (imperative).

3. **Facts Are Your Friends**: Ansible automatically gathers detailed information about each host, making it easy to create dynamic, host-specific configurations.

4. **Templates Enable Consistency**: Jinja2 templates allow standardized configurations that adapt to each server's specifics - one template, many unique outputs.

5. **Agentless is Simple**: No agents to install, update, or troubleshoot. Just SSH and Python, which are already everywhere.

### Real-World Value

**Why Ansible Matters for DevOps/SRE Roles**:

- **Scale**: Manage thousands of servers with the same effort as managing one
- **Consistency**: Eliminate configuration drift and "snowflake servers"
- **Speed**: Automate tasks that would take hours/days manually
- **Reliability**: Idempotent operations reduce errors and increase confidence
- **Collaboration**: YAML playbooks are readable by both ops and dev teams
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations tracked like code

**Where This Fits in the DevOps Toolchain**:

```
Development → CI/CD → Configuration Management → Monitoring
              Jenkins   Ansible                    Prometheus
              GitLab    (THIS PROJECT)             Grafana
```

Ansible bridges the gap between code deployment and production operations.

### Personal Insights

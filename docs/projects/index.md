4. **Document your learnings** - Keep notes on challenges and solutions
5. **Build incrementally** - Start simple, add complexity
6. **Practice repeatedly** - Destroy and rebuild to reinforce learning

### Best Practices:

- **Version control everything** - Commit often with clear messages
- **Use descriptive names** - Make code self-documenting
- **Add comments** - Explain non-obvious logic

## 📝 Notes & Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways So Far:

**Project 1 (Terraform):**
- Always use `eval $(minikube docker-env)` when building images for Minikube
- Variables make configurations reusable and maintainable
- Terraform state is critical - handle with care

**Project 2 (Kubernetes):**
- WSL networking requires special consideration for accessing services
- `imagePullPolicy: Never` requires images to exist in Minikube's container runtime
- Use `minikube image load` to make Docker images available to Kubernetes
- Health checks are essential for production-ready deployments

**Project 3 (Ansible):**
- Idempotency is a core principle - design tasks to be safely repeatable
- Templates (Jinja2) enable dynamic, host-specific configurations
- Handlers ensure services restart only when necessary
- Ad-hoc commands are powerful for quick tasks

### Common Patterns:
- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Test each component independently before integration
- Documentation is as important as code
- Clean up resources after experimentation
